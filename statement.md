# Project Statement – Fitness Tracker (Java)

## 1. Introduction
This project is a console-based **Fitness Tracker** developed in Java. It allows users to record their daily fitness activities, such as exercise type, duration, calories burned, and date. The project focuses on applying core Java concepts learned during the course.

---

## 2. Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

- To apply Object-Oriented Programming principles in a real program.
- To store and retrieve user data using file handling.
- To use multithreading to improve program interaction.
- To manage user inputs securely with exception handling.
- To develop a well-organized and modular Java application.

---

## 3. Concepts Used

### ✔ Object-Oriented Programming
The project uses classes like:
- `Activity` (model class)
- `ActivityManager`
- `FileManager`
- `MotivationThread`
- `FitnessApp`

OOP concepts used:
- Encapsulation  
- Multiple classes  
- Methods and objects

---

### ✔ Arrays
Activities are stored in arrays internally before saving to file.

---

### ✔ Exception Handling
The program handles:
- Invalid input
- File errors
- Custom error cases

---

### ✔ File Handling
User activity data is saved and loaded from a `.txt` file to make the application persistent.

---

### ✔ Multithreading
A background thread is used to show motivational messages while the user uses the app.

---

## 4. Output
The user can:

- Add new activities  
- View history  
- Save activities  
- Retrieve them later

---

## 5. Conclusion
The Fitness Tracker project strengthened understanding of Java programming by combining multiple concepts into a working application. It mimics a real-world system while being simple enough for learning and practice.
