# Project Statement – Fitness Tracker (Java)

## 1. Problem Statement
In today’s busy lifestyle, many individuals engage in physical exercise but struggle to keep track of their daily fitness activities such as workout time, calories burned, and type of exercise. Without tracking, it becomes difficult to evaluate progress, maintain motivation, or build consistent fitness habits.

This project aims to provide a simple, console-based Fitness Tracker system where users can log and review their workout activities in an organized manner. The application stores data in a text file so that users can view their fitness history any time.

  - Duration  
  - Calories burned  
  - Date
- Storing the logged activities in a text file for permanent storage.
- Displaying previously recorded fitness history.
- Handling invalid inputs using exception handling.
- Running motivational messages using multithreading.

The application is designed as a medium-complexity learning project focused on applying Java concepts like OOP, arrays, file handling, exception handling, and multithreading.
